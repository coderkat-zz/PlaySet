# A simple python 'Set' solver!

## The Game
In case you're unfamiliar with Set, you can [read about it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(game)) or [try this tutorial](http://www.setgame.com/sites/default/files/tutorials/tutorial/SetTutorial.swf).

## The Program
Given a number of cards in a player's hand, this Set solver takes an arbitrary (user-provided) number of dimensions per card (i.e. a card has a background color in addition to color, shape, shading, and number, giving the card 5 dimensions) and an arbitrary size (i.e. each card may now have 4 of every dimension instead of the standard 3).

The solver will print out the player's hand as well as every possible set that can be made from that hand.
